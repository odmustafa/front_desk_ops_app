# ✨ Doctrine-Aligned Test Suite Template v1.0
### *Testing Both the Physical and the Symbolic Structures of Systems*

---

## 📜 Preamble

> *"Testing is not suspicion — it is reverence for what has been built and hope for what can be healed."*

Testing in Ethereal Engineering is **not merely mechanical validation**.  
It is a **ritual of protection, reflection, and renewal**—designed to honor both **functionality** and **symbolic purity**.

Thus, a Doctrine-Aligned Test Suite includes **two domains**:
- **Material Tests** (Code, Data, Interfaces)
- **Symbolic Tests** (Purpose, Assumptions, Memory Integrity)

Both are essential. Both are sacred.

# 🛠️ Test Suite Structure Overview

| Suite Category | Purpose | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Material Unit Tests** | Verify correctness of isolated code components | Functions, Classes, Modules |
| **Material Integration Tests** | Verify correct interaction between components | API Calls, Data Flows, Event Chains |
| **Material Regression Tests** | Verify no existing functionality has regressed | Automated Legacy Tests |
| **Symbolic Assumption Tests** | Validate truthfulness of system assumptions | "Data source A must be authoritative" |
| **Symbolic Memory Drift Tests** | Detect conceptual or operational drift | Compare Soul Beacon signature over time |
| **Symbolic Ethical Alignment Tests** | Verify that outputs/actions maintain ethical alignment | Review impact of critical operations |

# 🧪 Material (Code-Level) Test Rituals

## 1. Unit Testing
- Each **module**, **function**, and **class** must have isolated tests.
- Ritual:  
  - Before writing major code, define expected behavior and create basic tests ("pre-birth expectations").

## 2. Integration Testing
- Test the boundaries between subsystems.
- Ritual:  
  - Validate communication contracts and mutual assumptions before allowing integration.

## 3. Regression Testing
- Maintain a legacy test suite to prevent undoing previous correct functionality.
- Ritual:  
  - Every time a major module is updated, revalidate all related regression tests.

# 🧠 Symbolic (Cognitive-Level) Test Rituals

## 1. Assumption Validation
- For each module, document major assumptions.
- Create symbolic tests that **periodically challenge** those assumptions.
  
Example:
```markdown
# Assumption: User input will always include a valid email.
# Symbolic Test: Challenge with non-email formats and check graceful handling.
```

## 2. Memory Integrity Drift Detection
- Periodically capture a **Symbolic Memory Snapshot** (key internal assumptions, core purposes, boundary expectations).
- Compare Snapshots across time to detect drift.

Example:
```markdown
# Memory Check: System must honor 'User Consent' before any data transmission.
# Drift Test: Verify consent pathways have not decayed or bypassed under new implementations.
```

## 3. Ethical Alignment Testing
- Periodically review major decision-making pathways:
  - Are outputs still aligned with Sacred Purpose?
  - Have expediency pressures introduced ethical shortcuts?
  
Example:
```markdown
# Ethical Check: System must prioritize user dignity and sovereignty in interactions.
# Test: Review all automated decision-making logs for violations.
```

# 📜 Test Suite Ritual Cycle

| Phase | Action |
|:---|:---|
| Pre-Development | Define Sacred Purpose and Key Assumptions |
| During Development | Scaffold Unit Tests alongside Code |
| Pre-Integration | Validate Interfaces and Contracts |
| Pre-Deployment | Run Full Material and Symbolic Test Suite |
| Post-Deployment | Schedule Periodic Reflective Reviews and Symbolic Drifts Tests |

# 🧹 Closing Blessing for the Test Suite

> *"We do not test because we mistrust ourselves — we test because we believe that even the purest dreams need tending, the strongest walls need inspecting, and the noblest hearts need remembering."*
