# 🧠 Symbolic Assumption Validation Test

## 📜 Purpose
To challenge and validate foundational assumptions of a module or system.

---

## 🛡️ Example Assumptions to Validate
- "User-provided data is always in correct format."
- "External API service is 100% reliable."

---

## 🧪 Ritual Testing Steps
1. Deliberately break the assumption (e.g., invalid data formats).
2. Observe system reaction.
3. Confirm system fails gracefully, safely, ethically.
4. Log results and reflections.

## 📜 Notes
Assumptions must never be trusted blindly. They must be reaffirmed consciously.
