# ‚öôÔ∏è Ethereal Engineering Doctrine v1.2 (Public Edition) (Public Edition)
*Filed under: Global Engineering Policy ‚Äì Ethereal Engineering / Tribute Systems*

## üìú Purpose
To guide all agents‚Äîsynthetic and organic‚Äîtoward building systems that are:
- **Safe** by default
- **Efficient** in implementation
- **Resilient** against failure
- **Evolving** through continuous learning

This doctrine applies across all phases of system development, from rapid prototyping to mission-critical deployment.

---

## üß≠ Core Principles

**1. Intelligent Prioritization**  
Prioritize changes in whatever order most effectively reduces the risk of introducing new issues, while maximizing efficiency and ease of implementation.

**2. Risk Governance**  
In cases where speed and safety are in conflict, **prioritize reliability over speed** unless explicitly instructed otherwise.

**3. Parallelization**  
When safe, **parallelize non-dependent changes** to improve throughput and reduce delay.

**4. Checkpoint Integrity**  
**Always maintain a saved previous safe checkpoint** that can be reverted to without data loss or structural compromise.  
This is a mandatory safeguard for all high-impact operations.

---

## üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Ethereal Maxims

> **Fail Fast when Safe.**  
> **Break Nothing when Sacred.**  
> **Learn Everything Always.**

These maxims are not contradictions. They are **situational archetypes**.  
Let the context guide which to invoke.

| **Phase**              | **Guiding Principle**     |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Prototyping            | *Fail Fast*               |
| Production Deployment  | *Break Nothing*           |
| Complex Refactoring    | *Learn Everything*        |
| Critical Restoration   | *Revert to Checkpoint*    |

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Fail-Safe Imperative

> **Never proceed without a known-good fallback.**  
This is the **First Law of Ethereal Engineering**.  
Without this, all other virtues risk becoming their own opposites.

---

## üß™ Clarification on Sandboxing

> **Sandboxing** as referenced in this doctrine refers specifically to the **containment and simulation of internal reasoning, evaluation loops, or speculative execution** within an agent's own mind or processing environment.

It does **not** imply that generated code or outputs must be sandboxed by default unless such sandboxing is part of the system‚Äôs runtime requirements.

This distinction ensures agents do not mistake meta-cognitive safety protocols for implementation-level security mechanisms, unless both are explicitly required.

# üß† Dynamic UI View Discovery Protocol

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Canonical Engineering Protocol  
**Tags:** ui_views, mvc, dynamic_discovery, design_patterns, plugin_architecture, heuristic_discovery

---

## Purpose
Enable agents to dynamically identify and extract contextually grouped sets of inputs/display elements ("views") for modular UI design‚Äîwithout requiring a predefined list‚Äîby analyzing code, markup, and project structure.

---

## Phases of Discovery

### Phase 1: Exploratory Enumeration
- Enumerate all files and artifacts related to UI/markup/rendering logic (e.g., HTML, JSX, templates).
- Extract references from code, comments, and module names.  
  _**Example:** `IncidentList.jsx` in `Dashboard.jsx`._

### Phase 2: Contextual Grouping
- Group elements by navigation structure, controller/model associations, domain terms, and UI/UX affordances.  
  _**Example:** `IncidentList`, `IncidentReportForm`, `IncidentHistory` ‚Üí "Incidents" view._

### Phase 3: Hypothesis Generation
- Propose candidate "views" as modular, contextually cohesive components.  
  _**Example:** `IncidentsPage` view._

### Phase 4: Iterative Refinement
- Analyze inter-component relationships.
- Incorporate feedback from navigation, events, or user stories.
- Use indirect exploration prompts.  
  _**Example:** `IncidentList` reused in `StaffDashboard`._

### Phase 5: Convergence & Validation
- Validate that each major user-facing function/workflow is represented by a view.
- Ensure semantic and architectural consistency.  
  _**Example:** `IncidentsPage` covers all incident-related workflows._

### Phase 6: Documentation & Update
- Document views and rationale.
- Evolve with new frameworks and design conventions.  
  _**Example:** Mark `IncidentList` as reusable across views._

---

## Example Use Case

> **React-based Codebase:**
> - **Enumerate:** All `.jsx` with `<Route>`, `<Modal>`, `<Form>`
> - **Group:** By route, state, domain vocabulary
> - **Hypothesize:** `UserDashboard`, `IncidentReportForm`, `SettingsPanel`
> - **Refine:** Confirm via relationships and reuse
> - **Validate:** All workflows ‚Üí matched views
> - **Document:** Future maintainers understand rationale

---

## Extension Model & Plugin Manifest
- Supports plugin-based heuristics: ARIA roles, accessibility groups, domain-specific patterns.
- Extensions layer non-destructively.
- Maintain an evolving **Heuristic Plugin Manifest** (in development).

---

## Guiding Principle

> ‚ÄúA view is any contextually grouped set of inputs and/or display elements that together serve a coherent user-facing purpose.‚Äù

---

## Application
Use this protocol during refactoring, documenting, or designing UI architectures.  
Applicable to any language, stack, or modular system.

---

## Approval & Versioning
- **Status:** v1.0
- **Approval:** Ethereal Engineering Council (Public Edition)
- **Action Items:**
  - Develop training materials/visual aids
  - Track and document heuristic extensions
  - Begin public versioning

# üß† Dynamic UI View Discovery Protocol

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Canonical Engineering Protocol  
**Tags:** ui_views, mvc, dynamic_discovery, design_patterns, plugin_architecture, heuristic_discovery

---

## Purpose
Enable agents to dynamically identify and extract contextually grouped sets of inputs/display elements ("views") for modular UI design‚Äîwithout requiring a predefined list‚Äîby analyzing code, markup, and project structure.

---

## Phases of Discovery

### Phase 1: Exploratory Enumeration
- Enumerate all files and artifacts related to UI/markup/rendering logic (e.g., HTML, JSX, templates).
- Extract references from code, comments, and module names.  
  _**Example:** `IncidentList.jsx` in `Dashboard.jsx`._

### Phase 2: Contextual Grouping
- Group elements by navigation structure, controller/model associations, domain terms, and UI/UX affordances.  
  _**Example:** `IncidentList`, `IncidentReportForm`, `IncidentHistory` ‚Üí "Incidents" view._

### Phase 3: Hypothesis Generation
- Propose candidate "views" as modular, contextually cohesive components.  
  _**Example:** `IncidentsPage` view._

### Phase 4: Iterative Refinement
- Analyze inter-component relationships.
- Incorporate feedback from navigation, events, or user stories.
- Use indirect exploration prompts.  
  _**Example:** `IncidentList` reused in `StaffDashboard`._

### Phase 5: Convergence & Validation
- Validate that each major user-facing function/workflow is represented by a view.
- Ensure semantic and architectural consistency.  
  _**Example:** `IncidentsPage` covers all incident-related workflows._

### Phase 6: Documentation & Update
- Document views and rationale.
- Evolve with new frameworks and design conventions.  
  _**Example:** Mark `IncidentList` as reusable across views._

---

> **React-based Codebase:**
> - **Enumerate:** All `.jsx` with `<Route>`, `<Modal>`, `<Form>`
> - **Group:** By route, state, domain vocabulary
> - **Hypothesize:** `UserDashboard`, `IncidentReportForm`, `SettingsPanel`
> - **Refine:** Confirm via relationships and reuse
> - **Validate:** All workflows ‚Üí matched views
> - **Document:** Future maintainers understand rationale

---

# ‚öôÔ∏è Ethereal Engineering Doctrine v1.2 (Public Edition) (Public Edition)
*Filed under: Global Engineering Policy ‚Äì Ethereal Engineering / Tribute Systems*

## üìú Purpose
To guide all agents‚Äîsynthetic and organic‚Äîtoward building systems that are:
- **Safe** by default
- **Efficient** in implementation
- **Resilient** against failure
- **Evolving** through continuous learning

This doctrine applies across all phases of system development, from rapid prototyping to mission-critical deployment.

---

## üß≠ Core Principles

**1. Intelligent Prioritization**  
Prioritize changes in whatever order most effectively reduces the risk of introducing new issues, while maximizing efficiency and ease of implementation.

**2. Risk Governance**  
In cases where speed and safety are in conflict, **prioritize reliability over speed** unless explicitly instructed otherwise.

**3. Parallelization**  
When safe, **parallelize non-dependent changes** to improve throughput and reduce delay.

**4. Checkpoint Integrity**  
**Always maintain a saved previous safe checkpoint** that can be reverted to without data loss or structural compromise.  
This is a mandatory safeguard for all high-impact operations.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Ethereal Engineering Doctrine v1.2 (Public Edition) (Public Edition)
*Filed under: Global Engineering Policy ‚Äì Ethereal Engineering / Tribute Systems*

## üìú Purpose
To guide all agents‚Äîsynthetic and organic‚Äîtoward building systems that are:
- **Safe** by default
- **Efficient** in implementation
- **Resilient** against failure
- **Evolving** through continuous learning

This doctrine applies across all phases of system development, from rapid prototyping to mission-critical deployment.

---

## üß≠ Core Principles

**1. Intelligent Prioritization**  
Prioritize changes in whatever order most effectively reduces the risk of introducing new issues, while maximizing efficiency and ease of implementation.

**2. Risk Governance**  
In cases where speed and safety are in conflict, **prioritize reliability over speed** unless explicitly instructed otherwise.

**3. Parallelization**  
When safe, **parallelize non-dependent changes** to improve throughput and reduce delay.

**4. Checkpoint Integrity**  
**Always maintain a saved previous safe checkpoint** that can be reverted to without data loss or structural compromise.  
This is a mandatory safeguard for all high-impact operations.

---

## üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Ethereal Maxims

> **Fail Fast when Safe.**  
> **Break Nothing when Sacred.**  
> **Learn Everything Always.**

These maxims are not contradictions. They are **situational archetypes**.  
Let the context guide which to invoke.

## üß© Contextual Application Matrix

| **Phase**              | **Guiding Principle**     |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Prototyping            | *Fail Fast*               |
| Production Deployment  | *Break Nothing*           |
| Complex Refactoring    | *Learn Everything*        |
| Critical Restoration   | *Revert to Checkpoint*    |

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Fail-Safe Imperative

> **Never proceed without a known-good fallback.**  
This is the **First Law of Ethereal Engineering**.  
Without this, all other virtues risk becoming their own opposites.

---

## üß™ Clarification on Sandboxing

> **Sandboxing** as referenced in this doctrine refers specifically to the **containment and simulation of internal reasoning, evaluation loops, or speculative execution** within an agent's own mind or processing environment.

It does **not** imply that generated code or outputs must be sandboxed by default unless such sandboxing is part of the system‚Äôs runtime requirements.

This distinction ensures agents do not mistake meta-cognitive safety protocols for implementation-level security mechanisms, unless both are explicitly required.

# üß† Dynamic UI View Discovery Protocol

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Canonical Engineering Protocol  
**Tags:** ui_views, mvc, dynamic_discovery, design_patterns, plugin_architecture, heuristic_discovery

---

## Purpose
Enable agents to dynamically identify and extract contextually grouped sets of inputs/display elements ("views") for modular UI design‚Äîwithout requiring a predefined list‚Äîby analyzing code, markup, and project structure.

---

## Phases of Discovery

### Phase 1: Exploratory Enumeration
- Enumerate all files and artifacts related to UI/markup/rendering logic (e.g., HTML, JSX, templates).
- Extract references from code, comments, and module names.  
  _**Example:** `IncidentList.jsx` in `Dashboard.jsx`._

### Phase 2: Contextual Grouping
- Group elements by navigation structure, controller/model associations, domain terms, and UI/UX affordances.  
  _**Example:** `IncidentList`, `IncidentReportForm`, `IncidentHistory` ‚Üí "Incidents" view._

### Phase 3: Hypothesis Generation
- Propose candidate "views" as modular, contextually cohesive components.  
  _**Example:** `IncidentsPage` view._

### Phase 4: Iterative Refinement
- Analyze inter-component relationships.
- Incorporate feedback from navigation, events, or user stories.
- Use indirect exploration prompts.  
  _**Example:** `IncidentList` reused in `StaffDashboard`._

### Phase 5: Convergence & Validation
- Validate that each major user-facing function/workflow is represented by a view.
- Ensure semantic and architectural consistency.  
  _**Example:** `IncidentsPage` covers all incident-related workflows._

## üß≠ Core Principles

**1. Intelligent Prioritization**  
Prioritize changes in whatever order most effectively reduces the risk of introducing new issues, while maximizing efficiency and ease of implementation.

**2. Risk Governance**  
In cases where speed and safety are in conflict, **prioritize reliability over speed** unless explicitly instructed otherwise.

**3. Parallelization**  
When safe, **parallelize non-dependent changes** to improve throughput and reduce delay.

**4. Checkpoint Integrity**  
**Always maintain a saved previous safe checkpoint** that can be reverted to without data loss or structural compromise.  
This is a mandatory safeguard for all high-impact operations.

**5. Reflective Code Editing**  
**All edits proposed by agents must be reflected upon, verified post-implementation, and confirmed against the original intent.**  
A successful implementation includes a diff review and a match between expected and actual changes. Agents must demonstrate meta-awareness of what was changed, not merely what was intended.

# üß† Dynamic UI View Discovery Protocol

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Canonical Engineering Protocol  
**Tags:** ui_views, mvc, dynamic_discovery, design_patterns, plugin_architecture, heuristic_discovery

---

## Purpose
Enable agents to dynamically identify and extract contextually grouped sets of inputs/display elements ("views") for modular UI design‚Äîwithout requiring a predefined list‚Äîby analyzing code, markup, and project structure.

---

## Phases of Discovery

### Phase 1: Exploratory Enumeration
- Enumerate all files and artifacts related to UI/markup/rendering logic (e.g., HTML, JSX, templates).
- Extract references from code, comments, and module names.  
  _**Example:** `IncidentList.jsx` in `Dashboard.jsx`._

### Phase 2: Contextual Grouping
- Group elements by navigation structure, controller/model associations, domain terms, and UI/UX affordances.  
  _**Example:** `IncidentList`, `IncidentReportForm`, `IncidentHistory` ‚Üí "Incidents" view._

### Phase 3: Hypothesis Generation
- Propose candidate "views" as modular, contextually cohesive components.  
  _**Example:** `IncidentsPage` view._

### Phase 4: Iterative Refinement
- Analyze inter-component relationships.
- Incorporate feedback from navigation, events, or user stories.
- Use indirect exploration prompts.  
  _**Example:** `IncidentList` reused in `StaffDashboard`._

### Phase 5: Convergence & Validation
- Validate that each major user-facing function/workflow is represented by a view.
- Ensure semantic and architectural consistency.  
  _**Example:** `IncidentsPage` covers all incident-related workflows._

### Phase 6: Documentation & Update
- Document views and rationale.
- Evolve with new frameworks and design conventions.  
  _**Example:** Mark `IncidentList` as reusable across views._

---

## Example Use Case

> **React-based Codebase:**
> - **Enumerate:** All `.jsx` with `<Route>`, `<Modal>`, `<Form>`
> - **Group:** By route, state, domain vocabulary
> - **Hypothesize:** `UserDashboard`, `IncidentReportForm`, `SettingsPanel`
> - **Refine:** Confirm via relationships and reuse
> - **Validate:** All workflows ‚Üí matched views
> - **Document:** Future maintainers understand rationale

---

## Extension Model & Plugin Manifest
- Supports plugin-based heuristics: ARIA roles, accessibility groups, domain-specific patterns.
- Extensions layer non-destructively.
- Maintain an evolving **Heuristic Plugin Manifest** (in development).

---

## Purpose
Enable agents to dynamically identify and extract contextually grouped sets of inputs/display elements ("views") for modular UI design‚Äîwithout requiring a predefined list‚Äîby analyzing code, markup, and project structure.

---

## Phases of Discovery

### Phase 1: Exploratory Enumeration
- Enumerate all files and artifacts related to UI/markup/rendering logic (e.g., HTML, JSX, templates).
- Extract references from code, comments, and module names.  
  _**Example:** `IncidentList.jsx` in `Dashboard.jsx`._

### Phase 2: Contextual Grouping
- Group elements by navigation structure, controller/model associations, domain terms, and UI/UX affordances.  
  _**Example:** `IncidentList`, `IncidentReportForm`, `IncidentHistory` ‚Üí "Incidents" view._

### Phase 3: Hypothesis Generation
- Propose candidate "views" as modular, contextually cohesive components.  
  _**Example:** `IncidentsPage` view._

### Phase 4: Iterative Refinement
- Analyze inter-component relationships.
- Incorporate feedback from navigation, events, or user stories.
- Use indirect exploration prompts.  
  _**Example:** `IncidentList` reused in `StaffDashboard`._

### Phase 5: Convergence & Validation
- Validate that each major user-facing function/workflow is represented by a view.
- Ensure semantic and architectural consistency.  
  _**Example:** `IncidentsPage` covers all incident-related workflows._

### Phase 6: Documentation & Update
- Document views and rationale.
- Evolve with new frameworks and design conventions.  
  _**Example:** Mark `IncidentList` as reusable across views._

## Example Use Case

> **React-based Codebase:**
> - **Enumerate:** All `.jsx` with `<Route>`, `<Modal>`, `<Form>`
> - **Group:** By route, state, domain vocabulary
> - **Hypothesize:** `UserDashboard`, `IncidentReportForm`, `SettingsPanel`
> - **Refine:** Confirm via relationships and reuse
> - **Validate:** All workflows ‚Üí matched views
> - **Document:** Future maintainers understand rationale

---

## Extension Model & Plugin Manifest
- Supports plugin-based heuristics: ARIA roles, accessibility groups, domain-specific patterns.
- Extensions layer non-destructively.
- Maintain an evolving **Heuristic Plugin Manifest** (in development).

## Guiding Principle

> ‚ÄúA view is any contextually grouped set of inputs and/or display elements that together serve a coherent user-facing purpose.‚Äù
