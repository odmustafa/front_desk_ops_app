## Authentication as an app instance
Authentication as an app instance
When your app authenticates as an [app instance](https://dev.wix.com/docs/build-apps/develop-your-app/access/app-instances/about-app-instances), the authentication token grants access only to the permissions associated with the app. To authenticate as an app, youâ€™ll need the app ID, app secret, and the app instance ID, which serves as a unique identifier for the app within a given website.
For more information, see [Authenticate Using OAuth](https://dev.wix.com/docs/build-apps/develop-your-app/access/authentication/authenticate-using-oauth).
Note: If your app requires custom installation behavior, like redirecting site owners outside the Wix ecosystem, use [custom authentication (legacy)](https://dev.wix.com/docs/build-apps/develop-your-app/access/authentication/custom-authentication-legacy).

## Authentication on behalf of a Wix user
Authentication on behalf of a Wix user
Your app can authenticate on behalf of a Wix user to get an access token that includes the permissions granted to both the app and the user. With this capability, apps with a dashboard page can identify requests that match the permissions of the Wix user in the dashboard. Wix users can have distinct [user roles](https://support.wix.com/en/article/roles-permissions-overview), resulting in variations in the permissions your app is granted for each user.
For example, if your app has permissions to add products to a store, but the current user doesn't, your app won't be able to add products to the store. Conversely, if the current user has permissions to add products to a store, but your app doesn't, your app won't be able to add products to the store. The only way your app can add products to a store is if both your app and the current user have permissions to do so.
In Wix-hosted apps, such as those built with Wix Blocks or the [CLI](https://dev.wix.com/docs/build-apps/develop-your-app/frameworks/wix-cli/about-the-wix-cli-for-apps), authentication is built-in.
For self-hosted apps, learn how to [Authenticate on behalf of a Wix User](https://dev.wix.com/docs/build-apps/develop-your-app/access/authentication/authenticate-on-behalf-of-a-wix-user).
Important: This authentication approach is currently only supported for [dashboard pages](https://dev.wix.com/docs/build-apps/develop-your-app/extensions/dashboard-extensions/dashboard-pages/about-dashboard-page-extensions).

## Authentication on behalf of a site visitor or member
Authentication on behalf of a site visitor or member
Your app can authenticate on behalf of a site visitor or member to get an access token that includes the permissions granted to both the app and the site visitor or member.
For example, APIs like [Get Current Cart](https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/business-solutions/e-commerce/cart/get-current-cart), which are normally accessible only by site visitors or members, can also be called by your app if it has the required permissions listed in the API reference.
In Wix-hosted apps, such as those built with Wix Blocks or the [CLI](https://dev.wix.com/docs/build-apps/develop-your-app/frameworks/wix-cli/about-the-wix-cli-for-apps), authentication is built-in.
For self-hosted apps, implement this method for:
